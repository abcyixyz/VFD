# VFD

A collection of upcycling projects for Vakuum Fluorescent Displays (VFD). These are Display as you may find in Audio/Video gear like CD/DVD players. A VFD requires high voltage to control anodes and gates, and a small AC voltage for the fillament(heater). To drive each single display element, a time multiplexed controller is required.

Some interesting plain VFDs, that means VFD without driver circuits, are available at pollin.de, they have mixed sets and a bunch of single 7 segment displays.
